# MkDocs

I need to start creating documentation for my projects. I also want a blog, mainly to document what I am doing so I can go back to it later. 

First I considered Astro for this purpose, but it's very complex and I don't want to spend time learning a new framework.

## Setup

For full documentation visit [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org).

Create a `python` virtual environment using direnv with the following `.envrc` file:

```bash
layout uv
```

Then add the packages:

```bash
uv add mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-blog-plugin
```


## Configuration

### Blog

The [Blog Plugin](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/tutorials/blogs/basic/) shows many options, e.g. for setting up navigation.

## Content

* docs/blog/posts/YYYY-MM-DD <title>.md
* docs/blog/index.md

## Commands

* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.

## Project layout

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
