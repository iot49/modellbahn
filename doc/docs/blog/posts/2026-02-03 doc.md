# Deploy Documentation to Cloudflare Pages at rails49.org

1. Link the Custom Domain

    1. Log in to the Cloudflare Dashboard.
    2. Go to Workers & Pages > Overview.
    3. Select your new project: rails49-doc.
    4. Click on the Custom domains tab.
    5. Click Set up a custom domain.
    6. Enter rails49.org and follow the prompts to activate it. (Since your DNS is already on Cloudflare, it should offer to automatically create the necessary CNAME record for you.)

2. Set Up GitHub Secrets (for Automation)
To enable the "Tag-Prefix" automated deployment we set up (
.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml
), you need to add two secrets to your GitHub repository:

    1. Go to your GitHub Repository > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions.
    2. Add the following Repository secrets:
        * CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: Create this in Cloudflare under My Profile > API Tokens using "Create Custom Token" with Permissions:
Account | Cloudflare Pages | Edit.
        * CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID: Found on the right-hand sidebar of your Cloudflare Dashboard's Account Home page.

3. Deployment
You can deploy the documentation in two ways:

#### A. Manual Deployment (Direct to Cloudflare)
Run the deploy script without arguments for a quick direct upload:
```bash
./bin/deploy
```

#### B. Automated Deployment (Via Tagged Release)
Run the deploy script with a version tag. This will verify the build, check links, and then push a `doc-*` tag to GitHub to trigger the automated workflow:
```bash
./bin/deploy v2026-02-03
```

This will:
1. Build the site with `--strict` (fails on any error).
2. Run the link checker.
3. Push the tag `doc-v2026-02-03` to GitHub.
4. Trigger the GitHub Action to deploy to `rails49.org`.
